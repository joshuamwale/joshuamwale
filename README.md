#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ Welcome. I'm glad to see you here. Here is my educational and training journey. âœ¨ 

* Iâ€™m currently enrolled at Moringa School for the Fullstack Software Engineering Program. I will be graduating by end of November, 2022 inshallah. My interests lie in Backend development.
* I plan to use the skills and knowledge I've gained to solve problems in healthcare, fintech, energy and our African agricultural systems using technology-based products and solutions.
* I studied Industrial chemistry at university but I am transitioning into software engineering and data analytics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* Project management - a Linkedin course

I'm having fun understanding how backend development works and how a framework like Ruby on Rails enables this.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
* Building APIs at scale 
* Building open source tools 
 
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
* Internship and job opportunities 
* Career mentorship
 
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
* Career transition journey and my motivation to ditch industrial chemistry and delve into software engineering (building computer programs, systems and apps) 
  
ðŸ“« How to reach me:

Don't hesitate to reach out if you are having a question or want us to have a fireside chat about anything, including philosophy and poetry.

âš¡ Fun facts:
* I write poems for inspiration and rejuvenation and expression. Code and poetry are two sides of the same coin I believe. 
* I am a bibliophile and read very widely (African literature, Shakespeare's play, Russian literature, Henrik Ibsen and Short stories). My current read is: Ibsen's Four great plays.
