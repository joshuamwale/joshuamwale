### Hi there 👋

✨ I'm glad to see you here ✨ 

I’m currently enrolled at Moringa School for the Fullstack Software Engineering Program. I will be graduating by end of November, 2022 inshallah. I plan to use the skills and knowledge I've gained to solve problems in healthcare, fintech, energy and our African agricultural systems using technology-based products and solutions.

I studied Industrial chemistry at university but my interests lie in software engineering and data science.

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* Project management

I'm having fun understanding how backend development works and how a framework like Ruby on Rails enables this.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
* Building APIs at scale 
* Building open source tools 
 
🤔 I’m looking for help with:
* Career mentorship
* Internship and job opportunities 
 
💬 Ask me about:
* Career transition journey and my motivation to delve into software engineering (building computer programs, systems and apps)
